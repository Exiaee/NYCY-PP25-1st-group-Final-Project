# NYCU PP25 Final Project - Image Retrieval Based on Perceptual Hashing and CUDA
This project aims to design a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system using **Perceptual Hash** to efficiently identify visually similar images. By extracting compact hash representations, the system enables fast ***search by image*** functionality in large-scale datasets. 

To address performance bottlenecks, parallel computing techniques are employed: **NVIDA CUDA** for GPU acceleration, and **OpenMP** for CPU multi-core parallelism have been included. These methods are applied to both hash generation and comparison phases to improve efficiency. The system seeks to deliver real-time image similarity retrieval with enhanced scalability and performance through the integration of perceptual hashing and high-performance parallelization.

- A command-line utility to generate pHash values for images in a dataset
- A graphical interface to compare images using **Hamming distance**
